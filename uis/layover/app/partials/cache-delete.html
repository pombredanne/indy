      This form is to delete broken or invalid cache files for groups and remote repositories, e.g,
      generated maven-metadata.xml for a group location, broken jar file from a remote repository, etc.
      There are some unusual cases that could break those files and the easy fix is to delete and regenerate it (in the next request).
